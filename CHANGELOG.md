# Sensu cookbook changelog

This file is used to track changes made in each version of the sensu cookbook.

## 2.12.0 - 2016-03-14

### Project changes

The Sensu cookbook project has adopted a new contribution workflow and a new code of conduct policy. Please see the relevant documents in repo for details.

### Behavior changes

* Values for `owner` and `group` properties on `sensu_json_file` resources now default to lazy evaluation of node attributes `sensu.admin_user` and `sensu.group` respectively. (#426)

* Data bags remain default source of SSL certificates, but are now optional:

	With the addition of Sensu state helpers in #410 recipes which access credentials via data bags (i.e. `default`, `rabbitmq` and `enterprise` recipes) have been updated to make these data bag items optional.

	Please see the readme and integration test suite for examples of using these helpers.

* Testing notes have been added in `TESTING.md` to describe some of the platform/suite combinations which are disabled or otherwise require special configuration.

### Features

Added [ChefSpec](https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec) test coverage for the following:

* `default` and `client_service` recipes
* `sensu_gem` LWRP
* Sensu::Helpers library `#select_attributes` and `#gem_binary`  methods

Added source attribute to sensu_gem resource
Added upgrade action to sensu_gem resource
Added helpers for storing key/value pairs which persist for duration of the Chef run
